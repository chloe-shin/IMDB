## Required Features : Please check what I have done
- [x] The user can see the top 20 "Currently Playing" movies on a page.

## Advanced Features:

- [x] The user can enter a term into a search box to filter the currently loaded movies by search term. E.g.; the user can type "mar" and the results are reduced to show "Captain Marvel".
- [x] Have Year, Rating as a slider. Change the display dynamically when the slider is changed.
- [ ] The user can change the "source" from "Currently Playing" movies to "Top Rated" movies (or any other of the endpoints supplied by MovieDB). 
- [ ] Sort by Rating and Popularity (from Lowest to Highest and Vice Versa)
- [ ] In addition to Previous and Next, use Number Pagination. Click on Number 3 will get them to Page3 and display movies 61st - 79th.
- [ ] For each movie, include a link (movie/id) to display the full Movie Info on another page (URL). Use React Router for this. You'll also have to figure out how to retrieve the parameters from the URL.
